# Table Unknown Project Ideas

Nick's Idea: A don't really care what app we create I am open to all ideas. I would prefer we
use the react/typescript systems for a frontend and for a backend I would prefer using dotnet. 
I would also be open to languages like Go or Dart as well. The one thing I really would prefer not 
to use is python, I dislike python.
