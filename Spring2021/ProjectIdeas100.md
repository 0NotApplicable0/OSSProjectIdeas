# Table Unknown Project Ideas

Nick's Idea: A don't really care what app we create I am open to all ideas. I would prefer we
use the react/typescript systems for a frontend and for a backend I would prefer using dotnet. 
I would also be open to languages like Go or Dart as well. The one thing I really would prefer not 
to use is python, I dislike python.

Thomas' Idea: I would prefer to create a project that is either web-based (i.e. a social media site) or
that utilizes an existing API, such as Google Maps. I don't have much experience using APIs, but I would
like to gain some exposure. Unlike Nick, I really enjoy using Python but I also support using most
object-oriented programming languages.
