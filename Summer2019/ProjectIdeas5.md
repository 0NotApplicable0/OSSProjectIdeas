I've been interested in creating software dealing with music creation, so I've been looking at Musescore, an open source music composition app. -Aidan Oakley  



I'm interested in making an app that uses an open source API for a a music data base and an API 
for spotify that can take in a spotify playlist look up the year of release for each song and 
calculate the median year of realease for all the songs.  This way when listening to a playlist
 on shuffle you can guess if the next song sill have come out before or after the median year.
