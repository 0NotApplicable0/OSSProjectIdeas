I've been interested in creating software dealing with music creation, so I've been looking at Musescore, an open source music composition app. -Aidan Oakley  

I'm interested in making an app that uses an open source API for a a music data base and an API 
for spotify that can take in a spotify playlist look up the year of release for each song and 
calculate the median year of realease for all the songs.  This way when listening to a playlist
 on shuffle you can guess if the next song sill have come out before or after the median year.

I'm part of the Student Senate Web Technologies group which works on projects like the ShuttleTracker and the Petitions site, so I am looking to work on one of these projects. -Evan Lazaro

Was possibly interested in running running statistical analytics on a game called Rocket League. Replays in the game give you lots of information so you can run analysis on player tendencies and outcomes of common situations that occur within the games. -Jack Cherella  

I'm interested in either continuing my RCOS project from last semester called AutoCalendar, which is more on the WebDev side. AutoCalendar is a web app that allows users to input all the details of their regular weekly schedules (i.e. clubs and classes with times, locations, and other related descriptors). Another idea I might go for is a program to help predict ideal draft picks for fantasy football teams, which falls more along the lines of analytical programming. - Priya Sapra

I have a bunch of old CDs with 16-bit games that are no longer supported on 64-bit windows. Due to other problems, they won't run on DOSBox either and the only way to realistically run them is from a relatively slow virtual machine with pirated Windows software (because they don't sell it anymore). I would like to create a 16-bit windows emulator that could run old 16-bit games and apps on modern Windows. -Thomas Beitel
 
I am part of an executive council of a sorority on campus. Since being on the E-board, I've found that our resources and information is very unorganized and difficult to find. I would love to make a clean UI where we can access things like our calander, budget, contact information, etc. - Virginia Barnes

I am considering making a tutroial/data base for learning how to use a program I have encountered in the past. I am between two different programs I am decididing between are Latex and Jupyter. I use Latex frequently as a text editor and I want to learn how to use it proficiently. I have used a lot of help from online wikis and tutotrials but most of this information is scattered and can feel overwhelming. I would want to make some sort of interface or compose a combination of writing intrcutions and examples to show how to use Latex as a beginner. Jupyter is something I have not used in over a year but like Latex, it has a steep learning curve and the infromation online is very scattered. I used it in Physics II Honors when I wasa physics major. I would be less familiar with this interface now but I feel as though I may have more experience with this than computer science majors, having at one point needing it for a class. -Chris Reed
