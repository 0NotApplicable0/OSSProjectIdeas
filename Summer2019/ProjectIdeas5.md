I've been interested in creating software dealing with music creation, so I've been looking at Musescore, an open source music composition app. -Aidan Oakley  

I'm part of the Student Senate Web Technologies group which works on projects like the ShuttleTracker and the Petitions site, so I am looking to work on one of these projects. -Evan Lazaro

Was possibly interested in running running statistical analytics on a game called Rocket League. Replays in the game give you lots of information so you can run analysis on player tendencies and outcomes of common situations that occur within the games. -Jack Cherella  

I'm interested in either continuing my RCOS project from last semester called AutoCalendar, which is more on the WebDev side. AutoCalendar is a web app that allows users to input all the details of their regular weekly schedules (i.e. clubs and classes with times, locations, and other related descriptors). Another idea I might go for is a program to help predict ideal draft picks for fantasy football teams, which falls more along the lines of analytical programming. - Priya Sapra

I have a bunch of old CDs with 16-bit games that are no longer supported on 64-bit windows. Due to other problems, they won't run on DOSBox either and the only way to realistically run them is from a relatively slow virtual machine with pirated Windows software (because they don't sell it anymore). I would like to create a 16-bit windows emulator that could run old 16-bit games and apps on modern Windows. -Thomas Beitel
 
I am part of an executive council of a sorority on campus. Since being on the E-board, I've found that our resources and information is very unorganized and difficult to find. I would love to make a clean UI where we can access things like our calander, budget, contact information, etc.
