The open source project I have identified as a possible area of interest is called Magenta. It is a project focusing on the use of machine learning through TensorFlow to create music and other art forms. The project uses deep learning to generate various forms of art such as music, images, pictures and etc. It isn't capable of creating it's own art but is aimed to helping artists improve their ideas in terms of handling certain processes in art creation. THe project is based on Python near exclusively. I don't have experience working with TensorFlow and machine learning in general but the project itself and what they are trying to do is of definate interest to me.
