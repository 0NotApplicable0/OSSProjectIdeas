We need to find a project we are interest in.

- Rongyi Zhang: I would like to work on a web game app, to practice using GUI and gain experience in web development.

- Yi Shen: games are nice, I am also interested in some data mining, machine learning or some web server development. In fact any interesting ideas works. 

- Donglin Liu: maybe shuttle tracker.

- Maoyu Wang: Some simple web applications will be good.
