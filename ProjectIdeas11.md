## Project ideas

# Cody Messina

I would like to work on tools to streamline and organize game development

Some projects I'm considering include [Aurora](https://github.com/evaera/Aurora) and [Nevermore Engine](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine)

# Alan Joy

I'd like to work on tools to make RPI's course management easier, but game development tools are also interesting to me.

I'm interested in working on [Schedj](https://github.com/Schedj)
